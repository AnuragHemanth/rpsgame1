HOW IT WORKS
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors designed to reduce the number of ties and add a bit more complexity and strategy. It was popularized by the TV show The Big Bang Theory, but it's based on the same basic premise: two players choose one of five possible items and compare their choices to determine the winner.

Here’s how it works:

The five possible choices:
Rock
Paper
Scissors
Lizard
Spock
The interactions:
Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins against Scissors)
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins against Paper)
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins against Rock)
Rock crushes Lizard (Rock wins against Lizard)
Lizard poisons Spock (Lizard wins against Spock)
Spock smashes Scissors (Spock wins against Scissors)
Scissors decapitates Lizard (Scissors wins against Lizard)
Lizard eats Paper (Lizard wins against Paper)
Paper disproves Spock (Paper wins against Spock)
Spock vaporizes Rock (Spock wins against Rock)
How it works:
Each player secretly chooses one of the five items (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock).
They reveal their choices at the same time.
The winner is determined based on the interactions listed above. If both players choose the same item, it’s a tie, and they usually play again.
The key to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is that the additional items (Lizard and Spock) make it harder for the players to predict the outcome, reducing the chances of ties and giving the game more variety.

For example, Rock doesn’t just beat Scissors; it also beats Lizard. Similarly, Spock is more powerful than just Scissors and Rock; it also defeats Paper and Lizard, adding more layers of strategy.
